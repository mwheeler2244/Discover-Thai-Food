              <p>
                Khao Soi is a Northern Thai dish that features a creamy, spicy
                coconut curry broth served over egg noodles. It's typically

                The dish often includes tender pieces of chicken or beef, and
                it's accompanied by a side of pickled mustard greens, shallots,
                lime, and chili oil.
              </p>
              <p>
                The combination of textures and flavors – creamy, crunchy,

                sausage made from ground pork mixed with a variety of herbs and

            <p>
              Gaeng Som is a tangy and spicy curry that is a staple of Southern
              Thai cuisine. The curry is made with a distinctive yellow curry
              paste, fish, and vegetables such as green papaya or bamboo shoots.
              Tamarind paste gives the curry its characteristic sour flavor,
              while the chili paste adds heat.

              Gaeng Som is known for its vibrant color and bold flavors, which
              can range from tangy and spicy to slightly sweet, depending on the
              ingredients used. This dish is often enjoyed with steamed rice and
              is a perfect representation of the bold and dynamic flavors found
              in Southern Thai cooking.
